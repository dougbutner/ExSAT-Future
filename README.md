# Welcome
### to Planet Earth ðŸŒŽ


Evolved from apes and aliens, humble humans emerged from caves to build the first permanent societies.
As tribes grew and fought, kingdoms were born to protect and create greater realities of co-creation.
Then, a system was created called money lending. 
This system has raised great skyscrapers, paved roads, and created  a new type of power: speculation.
Then, cracks emerged. 
Through compounding interest, the sails have become shackles, and the reins chains.
Global debt is over 2.5X total money supply 
Greedy, faceless creditors have taken over the planet. 
What's next in the evolution of the human race?
                                                                                                    



# Evolution
### of power

Centralized power and distribution of resources has been the cornerstone of society's evolution. 
We have developed great systems to put people into power, trusting that they will serve the masses for the greater good of all.
Until recent history, we have made continual improvement on how we bring people into power, and how that power is distributed.
 From tribes, to kings and emperors, to republics and democracy, we are always advancing.
An overlooked aspect of society's advancement is that in the past were always somewhat disconnected, allowing one culture to develop its own system that works at that time and place. As information channels grew more connected, many republics started to copy each other looking up to big brother for solutions instead of leaning into their own strengths.
What once was public servitude has become a game of popularity, fueled by advertising.
Where wise elders once met to decide what is best for the tribe, now lobbyists represent corporate interests write the laws that politicians pass off as their own. 
In the United States, lobbying is an excepted practice where corporations pay to have their needs met by legislators.
While our systems of government have reached a positive plateau, democracy, a new game has darkened the skies, a game of finance where runaway compounding interest has created an impossible game where there is more debt than money in the world, which should make no sense because it isn't real. 
It's an illusion that is used to keep us in chains, so that all of the value in society goes towards the creditors, and the debtors continue to slave away to pay for the things they need to live.
